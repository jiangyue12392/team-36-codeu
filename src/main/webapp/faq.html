            One of the novel features of our website is the sentiment score analysis. Each review posted is analysed by our smart servers to generate a 'sentiment score'. This score ranges from -1 to 1, based on how negative/positive the language you used in your
            comment is.
          </p>
          <p>Based on these individual scores, we have generated an aggregate value for each theatre, which is the number you see. This will allow you to quickly guage how other users are feeling about the chosen theatre! Pretty cool, isn't it?</p>
